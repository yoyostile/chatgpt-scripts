# ChatGPT Script Collection 🤖

A collection of various scripts generated by ChatGPT for me. Each script lives in its own subdirectory.

## Structure 🗂️

```
.
├── Script1/
│   └── README.md
├── Script2/
│   └── README.md
...
```

Each subdirectory contains the script and a `README.md` explaining its purpose and usage.

## How to Use 🚀

1. Navigate to the script's subdirectory.
2. Follow the instructions in its `README.md`.

Enjoy exploring! 🌟
